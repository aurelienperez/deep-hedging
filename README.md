# Deep Hedging under Market Frictions

This project compares two hedging strategies in the presence of transaction costs:

- **Delta Hedging** (Black-Scholes-based)
- **Deep Hedging** (neural networks trained to minimise hedging risk)

The goal is to evaluate the performance of data-driven hedging under realistic market frictions.
